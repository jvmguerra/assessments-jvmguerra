## Description:
You are required to build an assignment generator that can generate assignments for a Specialist Frontend position. The generator should take input fields such as **Title**, **Position**, **Level**, **Technologies**, and **Description** and generate assignments based on these inputs. The goal is to test the candidate's skills on Nextjs, Langchain, GPT-4, and Tailwindcss.

## Requirements:

1. The generator should have a user-friendly interface where the user can input the required fields.

2. The generator should validate the inputs to ensure that all fields are filled correctly.

3. The generator should be able to generate a unique assignment based on the inputs provided by the user.

4. The generated assignment should include a title, position, level, technologies, and description.

5. The technologies field should provide suggestions or auto-complete options based on the input.

6. The generator should be built using Nextjs, Langchain, GPT-4, and Tailwindcss.

7. The generated assignment should follow the best practices and guidelines provided by Nextjs, Langchain, GPT-4, and Tailwindcss.

## Bonus Points:

- Create a responsive design using Tailwindcss to ensure the generator works well on different screen sizes.

## Deliverables:

- A functional assignment generator that meets the requirements mentioned above.

- Documentation on how to use the assignment generator and any additional features implemented.

- Optionally, a report on the testing and performance of the assignment generator.

Your assignment generator will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- Implementation of the required functionality.

- Correct integration of Nextjs, Langchain, GPT-4, and Tailwindcss.

- User-friendliness and validation of the input fields.

- Generation of unique assignments.
